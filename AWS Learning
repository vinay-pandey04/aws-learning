Regions - i.e. us-east-1
	avalability zones - us-east-1a, us-east-1b
	data centers(avalability zones)


Iam(identity and access management) service: global

	- Users and group can be assign json polices (permissions)
	- MFA(multi factor authentication) - Virutal MFA device(authy), physical device
	
	- AWS CLI
		- installer download
		- create access keys for aws
		- aws configure (fill all fields)
		- aws iam list-users
	- aws cloudwatch (command line tool in aws ui interface)
	
	- Credential Report (Account level, All User details, password, access details, creation date)
	- Access advisor (User level, audit for user accessing all services)
	

EC2 Fundamentals:

	- Budget setup (set monthly budget threshold)
	- EC2 instance types (t2 micro, t2xlarge based on configuration) t2 micro is free tier
	- EC2 User Data - scripts that run while set up of ec2 instance once ( for example downloading softwares, drivers at instance creation)
	- AMI (Amazon machine image) used for instance creation
	- EC2 instance types:
		- General Purpose (t2 micro, balance b/w Compute, Network and Memory)
		- Compute Optimised (high performance web servers, batch processing, Media transcoding, ml, gaming servers etc)
		- Memory Optimized ( real time processing, in memory dbs, distributed web scale caching)
		- Storage Optimized (high frequency online transaction processing, Relational & no sql dbs, cache for in memory dbs, data warehousing, distributed file systems)
	- Security Groups - Controls how traffic is allowed into and outside of ec2 instances.
		- Allow rules (inbound and outbound)
		- Can apply to multiple instances
		- Locked down to a region or VPC combination
		- good to maintain one security group for SSH access.
		- if application is timeout (security group issue)
		- If application gives Connection Refused error, application issue
	- Classic ports to know:
		- 22 = SSH - Log into linux instance
		- 21 = FTP
		- 22 = SFTP (secure FTP using SSH)
		- 80 = HTTP (access unsecured websites)
		- 443 = HTTPs
		- 3389 = RDP
	- SSH using windows for login to ec2 instance
		- command: ssh -i path_to_.pem_file ec2-user@public_ip_of_instance
	-ec2 instance roles
		- assign iamreadonly roles to ec2 instance 
		- configureing using aws configure is not a good practice in ec2 instances
		- command aws iam list-users
	- ec2 instance purchasing options:
		- On Demand (short workload timings, predictable price)
		- Reserved (Min 1 year) 75% discount compared to on demand
		- Spot instances (can loose instances, cheap, short workload) 90% discount then On Demand
		- Dedicated hosts (Book entire server, control instance placement)
		
		
EBS (Elastic Block Storage):

	- EBS allows to store instance data even after they are terminates
	- network usb sticks having limited performance
	- free tier (30 gb)
	- can be attached to another instance
	- locked to a availability zone
	- multiple EBS volumes can be attached to single ec2 instance
	- snapshot is required for attaching/copying EBS to another availabity zone and region
	- snapshots can be copied/backed up in another region too.
	- AMI
		- Customization of ec2 instances
		- Build for specific region
		- instances can be launched from AMIs
		- pre packaged software/configuration in form of AMIs
	- EC2 instannce store - better I/O performance
		- Can be attached to multiple ec2 instances but doesn't exist after instance termination.
		- Can be used for buffer/temp/cached data, faster storage.
	EBS Volume Types:
		- General Purpose SSD
			- Cost effective storage, low-latency
			- 1GiB - 16Tib
		- Provisioned IOPs SSD
			- For critical business apps with sustained IOS performance
			- Great for databases workloads
			- 4Gib - 64 Tib
			- Support EBS multiattach
		- Hard disk drives
			- lowest cost
			- Big data, data warehouses, logs processing
	EBS Multi attach:
		- Attach the same EBS volume to multiple availability zones
		
	EFS (Elastic file system)
		- mountes 100s of instances across AZ
		- shared across multiple availability zones instances
		- expensive, scalable, highly available
		- Only works for linux based amis not windows.
		- Performance mode
			- General purpose
			- Max I/O - big data processing, media processing, throughput
			
	EBS vs EFS:
		- EBS can only be attached to single instance at a time, but EFS can be connected to multiple instances at a time.
		- EFS is expensive than EBS
		- EFS can be attached to only linux amis and instances.
		
		
Elastic Load Balancer: 

		- For High availability, without using instance ips, handling failures, dns for accessing service
		- Classic Load Balancer(Depricated now by AWS) - OLD - 2009 - TCP, HTTP, HTTPS
		- Application Load Balancer - HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
			- Layer 7 (HTTP)
			- Load balancing to multiple machines/same machine(with containers)
			- redirects traffic from http to https
			- great for microservices and containter based applications
			- Routing based on URL/path i.e. example.com/users, example.com/links etc
			- Rouing based on hostname i.e. one.example.com, two.example.com
			- Routing based on query string i.e. one.examle.com?search=test
			- multiple classic load balancers will be required to achieve all this.
			- 400 ms latency
			- doesn't support static ips, hostname is static though.
		- Network Load Balancer - TCP, TLS, UDP
			- Handles millions of request per second
			- lower level 4 load balancer
			- Less latency ~100ms
			- Supports assigning one static IP per availability zone and supports elastic IP (helpful for whitelist specific instances/IP)
		- Gateway load balancer
		- Session Affinity (sticky sessions)
			- Allowing user to use classic and Application load balancer to use same instance for a specific time.
			- cookie based - expiration date for using same instance. After that requests will be forwarded to new instance.
			- Application based cookie:
				- Custom cookie
					- can include any cookie name
					- generated by target
					- don't use specific cookies used by ALB application itself (AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, AWSALBTG)
				- Application cookie
					- generated by load balancer
					- name as AWSALBAPP
			- Duration based cookies:
				- generated by load balancer
				- name as AWSALB for ALB, AWSCLB for CLB
				- specific duration can be configured by application
			
		Cross Zone load balancing:
		
			- Used to load balance between multiple availability zones. i.e. one load balancer can forward requests to different availability zone too.
			- configurable: can be switched off depedning on the use case.
			- when off, ALB will send request to only the availability zone it belongs to.
			- Always on for ALB,charges are applicable when requests get distributed b/w different AZones
			- For NLB, its Off by default, chargeable 
			- CLB, on by default, no charge when traffic transfers across AZ


	SSL/TLS basics:
	
		- SSL certificate allows traffic b/w client and load balancer  to be encrypted during trasit.
		- Secure Sockets layer used to encrypt connections
		- TLS - Transport layer security - Newer version
		- Nowadays TLS certs are mainly used but still referred as ssl certs
		- Public ssls are issue by Certicate Authorities
		- have an expiration date
		- Load balancer uses an X.509 ssl/tls certificate
		- From client to Load balancer traffic is sent in HTTPS protocol.
		- From Load balancer to ec2 instance traffic is sent over private VPC in HTTP protocol but its secure.
		- ACS (AWS Certificate Manager is used to manage certificate, create/upload your certs
		- SSL - SNI(Server Name indication):
			- Used to solve the problem of loading multiple certificates for different target groups onto web server (to serve multiple websites)
			- newer protocol and requires that client indicates the hostname at inital SSL handshake.
			- If certicate is there in web server, it will return with that certicate or return a default.
			- Only works for ALB and NLB, Cloudfront not CLB
		- Connection Draining for CLB
			- Stated as De-registration delay for ALB, NLB
			- Means that while instances are going to be unhealthy and user is making requests, user should be allowed some time to complete his tasks.
			  During this instance will slowly terminate depending on this period. value can be set to 0 or 1-3600 seconds. 
	Generally, Security Group of EC2 instance is linked to load balancer for allowing traffic only through load balancer.
	
	
	Auto Scaling group:
	
		- Allows adding new instances and autoscales
		- Minium size, desired size and maximum size 
		- Can be scaled out(increase instances) or scaled in (decrease instances) as per Cloudwatch alarms
		- Good Metrics:
			- percentage of cpu usage
			- requests count per target  
			- Network in/out 
		- Can use launch templates
		- ASG are free
		- Scaling polices:
			- Target tracking scaling:
				- ie.CPU usage
			- Simple/Step Scaling:
				- cloudwatch alarm trigger, then add 2 units
			- Scheduled scaling:
				- i.e. increase instance every friday from 5 to 10 pm
			- predictive scaling:
				- forecast load and schedule scaling based on that.
		- Scaling cooldown:
			- default 300 secs
			- Is used by ASG after any scaling activity
			- during cooldown ASG doesn't launch any new instance/terminate existing.
			- To handle this we can create our AMIs ready to use and reduce cooldown period.
			
			
	RDS (Relational Database Service):
	
		- Postgres, Oracle, sql server, Mysql, MariaDB, Aurora(by aws) are available
		- managed service, continuous backups, monitoring dashboard, read replicas, maintenance windows, scaling capability, multi Ava Zones setup
		- You can't ssh into RDS instances.
		- Automated backups:
			- 7 day retention by default but upto 35 days can be done.
			- daily backups
			- transactin logs at every 5 mins
		- DB snapshots:
			- 6 month point of time backup by user	
		- Autoscales when capacity is low.
		- RDS Read Replicas:
			- Can create upto 5 
			- within AZ, across AZ and across Regions
			- Replication is async so reads are eventually consistent.
			- Replicas can be promoted to own database.
			- For RDS read replicas within the same region, there is no fee.
			- Across region read replica have some cost.
			- For disaster recovery, read replicas can be setup as Multi AZ and Multi AZ syncs along with main RDS all the time.
		- RDS Security Encryption:
			- At Rest Encryption 
				- Possible to encrypt master and read replicas with AWS KMS - AES 256 encryption
				- Read replicas can be encrypted only after master is encrypted.
				- Has to be defined at launch time.
				- Transparent Data Encryption is available at launch time.
			- In Flight Encryption
				- SSL certs to encryptdata.
				- Provides ssl options while connecting to db
		- RDS Encrypting options:
			- Encrypting RDS backups:
				- Snapshots of unencrypted databases are unencrypted
				- Snapshots of encrypted databases are encrypted
				- Can copy a snapshot into encrypted one.
			- Encrypt and unencrypted database:
				- Create snapshot of unencrypted database.
				- Copy the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot.
				- Restore db from encrypted snapshot.
				- Migrate application from old db to new db.
				
		- IAM authentication:
			- IAM authentication works with only Mysql and Postgres sql.
			- RDS service uses authentication token valid for 15 mins.
